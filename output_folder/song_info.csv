Ten toes ain't nine toes

Up but one finger for the trigger

Grrah

Uh-oh, who's on who?

Said you let it ring, but it never goes through

My mind's fucked, my head's gone too

The smoke's with the mandem, but the joke's on you

Uh-oh, who's on what?

Don't tell my brothers cah we'll spin the whole block

What we buyin'? Everything you got

Tell them little pussies that we take the whole lot

You ain't got no backbone

I get it out the trap, I ain't got a trap phone

I got Ps and Ms and Ks and Os

They're illiterate with letters, so I'm lettin' niggas know

Used to give them high-fives, now it's just a middle finger

Diamonds on my Patty, do the Bogle when I linger

They think I'm a rapper, I think I'm a singer (yo)

Catch me in the cut, I treat the Urus like a dinger

Get you southern-fried, I'm a South boy on some South shit

This is Chase & Status, this ain't all that fuckin' house shit

I score a goal and I do my dance, I Peter Crouch it

Heard them brothers wanna do me somethin', but I doubt it

Do me somethin' then, do me somethin' if you're bad

My mother calls me Mike, but I think I'm Jack the Lad

Tell us what you're workin' with, don't tell us what you had

I need to start my sentences with ""Sorry, may I add"" (whoo)

You ain't got no backbone

You ain't got no backbone

Uh-oh, who's on greaze?

Said you got the mash, but you never let it squeeze

My head's hot, my wrist on freeze

I keep a little somethin' for you pussy emcees

Uh-oh, who's on what?

Don't tell my brothers, cah they'll spin the whole block

What we buyin'? Everything you got (yo)

Tell them little pussies that we take the whole lot (whoo)

You ain't got no backbone

You ain't got no backbone

Do me somethin' then, do me somethin' if you're lit

Don't tell us how it used to be, just tell us what it is

They never gave me nothin', so it's fair I take the piss, pussy"

Fake niggas get left in the rain
Think 'cause I'm up there sitting on a plane
That I can't really hear what the people are saying

Lord of the Mics, fam, I could have clashed any man
But I said fam, let me clash Devilman

And when you talk about 0121, I know some serious people
In some serious places
I saw your set and it's basic
You try fake it
Did a YouTube video, none of your guys in the back ever showed their faces
'Cause they know Devilman did snitch on some serious cases
Say my name, nah, that's not right
Heart on my sleeve any time that I write
Them man can't say anything that I ain't already told man about my life
Made a couple shit songs, yeah that's nice
Repeated my bars, oh yeah that's nice
'Cause when your bars are hard like mine fam
Sometimes manna gotta say them twice
Fact of the matter is my bars totally murk
Your bars sound like you're smoking the work
Before you end up on the sex offenders list
Manna gon' put the devil in the dirt
Wah gwan for certain man
Thought it was a clash about music
All of a sudden Devilman, you wanna sperm on man
Like a TV, you wanna turn on man
Talk about music, me and my bros are killing it all over the globe
Now you're angry 'cause everybody on your road is asking for me like the Wi-Fi code

I’m on the floor tryna fight for my life,
It’s that, same old story,
Got stabbed a few times with a knife,

And I don’t think that I’m gonna make it,
I feel cold inside,
il be dead in about 3 minutes,
If they don’t stop the bleeding in time,

Another brudda dead it’s dumb,
My time is up in this world I’m leaving,
So can somebody phone my mum,
Tell her that i wont be home this evening,

The mandem look sad,
They felt the pain when i said this rhyme,
Before i go can you tell my Dad,
I’m sorry that we never made up in, time,

So what would you do?
If you had 3 Minutes To Live?

Because we as people
We take life for granted
And I can’t believe that shit,

Yeah thats me,
Lying on the floor i think i blacked out,
I couldn’t even breathe but i never tapped out,
Cah mummy never raised a brudda to back down

So i keep on, fighting, fighting,
Just to stay alive I’m back now,
Paramedics said suttin bout an artery,
And can everybody move to the background,

Somebody please help me,
I can’t feel my legs no more,
Thinking I could of gonna anywhere I want in life why the fuck did i choose this door,

And to that dickhead yute that stabbed me brudda why the fuck did you kill me for,
Got so many young kids that are dying nowadays why the fuck did you kill one more, black out,

I was never on time i was gonna improve but I can’t be late no more,
I swear they say i’ve never felt so alive yeh I can’t relate no more,

Like who’s the best baller alive fam i can’t debate no more,
When I got stabbed by a Griezmann shit got Messi and I can’t explain no more

See I could of had children,
A little beautiful brown eyed daughter,
If she couldn’t skate, then daddy would of taught her,
And how to swim not be scared of the water,

And even though you won’t be born,
Coz of these stab wounds i can’t hug you,
This is a note to what could of been my children just know Daddy would of loved you,

Yeah daddy would of been there to guide you in life to not make mistakes like he,
Yeah daddy would of been there to kiss it all better when you scrapped your very first knee,

Now, Daddy won’t be with you,
You wont even exist,
All coz this yute was intent on taking my life your taking this piss

Nah i going out like this, fuck that,
I claw my way from the dark and come back I ain’t gonna leave nobody with no contact for them to be sitting by the grave with cognac,

Somebody better try con-tact the lord for my soul and tell him that i want that,
I don’t care what a man’s gotta do to survive just tell the breddah that a mans on that

If i gotta keep fighting then I’m on that,
il change my life for the better,
il-even stop walking with a complex,
And i won’t chase this vendetta,

il tell my mum that i love her,
Every single day on the phone,
So please can you grant my wish,
All i really want is just to go home,

That’s the sound of my heartbeat fading,

Telling myself no don’t go sleep,

For the last time I’m not ready to leave
what’s that daylight that a brudda can see if i just believe, nobody grieves,
Hold up lemme just try and breathe,

Appetite to write like Frederick Douglass with a slave hand
Street pressure, word to Papa, I ain't going under
One day I'll have a label and make deals with Tommy Mottola
Mama always told me, ""You're one in a million""
Always watch your back, never tangle with Haitian Sicilians
Now I got a record deal, ""How does it feel?""
I'm never gonna survive unless I get crazy like Seal
'Cause the whole world's out of order

Driving in my fast car, playing Tracy Chapman

Eminem,Rap God,Eminem - Rap God.mp3,"rap, hip hop, detroit hip hop","Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)

This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half

Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students

Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"" That's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""Way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy

Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""Hell, yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'

I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes

To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm

Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future

Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating

'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop, "" 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it

I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?

Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you

Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me

They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?

Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"

Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five

Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

[Post-Chorus]
(Master, master, master, master)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

[Refrain]
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[Laughter]"
